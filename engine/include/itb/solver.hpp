// Stage 9: the perfect-turn search.
//
// solve_turn finds the player's best plan for this turn: the sequence of
// moves, weapon shots and repairs that maximizes score_turn(before, after)
// (score.hpp, strict lexicographic tiers), where `after` is the board at the
// end of the enemy phase (Engine::end_turn). Only what the player can see is
// used: hidden spawn types emerge as unknown (TurnContext::spawn_types), as
// the engine already does.
//
// Chance is adversarial. Every chance node the engine exposes (Grid Defense
// rolls, environment orders and choices, mission picks, spider eggs, the seed
// of a death effect that draws random numbers) is resolved to the outcome
// that is worst for the player:
//   - a plan's value is the minimum score over every chance outcome of the
//     enemy phase;
//   - a chance node during the player's own actions branches the plan: the
//     player sees the outcome before choosing the next action, so the value
//     is min over the outcomes of the best continuation (Plan::contingent).
//
// Action model. At every point of the turn the player may end the turn, or
// give any controllable unit (Pawn::controlled(), alive) one sub-action the
// engine accepts (ActionOptions::check_legal):
//   - Move to any tile of its move area (the Lua Move skill's target area), if
//     it can still move (movement.hpp can_move: not moved, or a bonus move
//     from Shifty / Post_Move);
//   - fire any non-passive weapon slot at any tile of its target area, and
//     for two-click weapons at any tile of the second target area;
//   - Repair (mechs; the pilot's repair skill) at any tile of its area.
// Sub-actions of different units interleave freely (A moves, B shoots, A
// shoots), and the engine's Pawn::FireWeapon bookkeeping decides what each
// unit may still do (Double_Shot, Shifty, Post_Move). Move undo is not part
// of the model (an undone move is the same as not moving).
//
// Search (solver.cpp has the details and the soundness argument of every
// bound):
//   - depth-first over sub-actions; every node is also a leaf ("end the turn
//     here"), so every prefix of a plan is itself a plan;
//   - a transposition table on the exact board hash (board_hash.hpp): orders
//     that reach the same board are one subproblem;
//   - end-of-turn values memoized on the End Turn board hash;
//   - chance branches enumerated lazily: the default outcome first, then each
//     recorded chance node's other options depth-first, stopping as soon as
//     the minimum can no longer beat the incumbent;
//   - alpha-beta over chance (min) nodes and branch-and-bound with sound,
//     tier-by-tier upper bounds;
//   - children ordered by the value of ending the turn right after them.
// The search is anytime: it returns the best plan found when the budget runs
// out, with a sound upper bound on what any plan can score.
