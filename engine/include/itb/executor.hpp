// Stages 3 and 4: push and death resolution, and the SkillEffect executor.
//
// The game resolves an effect in real time: entries are applied in chunks
// separated by delays, projectiles fly, pushes take 0.4 s, explosions and
// death animations keep the board busy, death effects and corpse explosions
// queue up behind. This executor replays that as an exact frame-clock
// simulation: an integer frame counter with a fixed frame rate (default 60
// fps), the game's six per-frame phases in order (weapon animations, tiles,
// pawns, stacked effects, quiescent work, render), and every timer converted
// to the frame on which the game's own float32 accumulation crosses its
// threshold (timing.hpp). Frames in which nothing can change are skipped, so
// the cost follows the number of events, not the elapsed time.
//
// At a fixed frame rate the result is deterministic. The few outcomes that
// depend on the frame rate (two interacting events within one frame of each
// other) are reported as TimingFlags so a solver can treat them as uncertain.
//
// Lua is not part of this stage. The weapon's GetSkillEffect result comes in
// as a SkillEffect; Pawn:GetDeathEffect, sScript and the spider-egg choice go
// through the hooks in ResolveContext.
