// Stage 7: the enemy phase, from End Turn to the end of the enemy's spawns.
//
// Engine::end_turn (engine.hpp) runs what the game does after End Turn, in
// order (stage 7 spec section 1), each step starting from an idle board and
// resolved to idle before the next:
//
//   1. Pawn::EndTurn on player-team pawns (the my-turn flag goes off, so
//      Networked Shielding is off for the whole phase), every web released.
//   2. Status ticks in six phases (necro, fire, Storm Generator, Psion
//      Tyrant, psion regeneration, Regen pilots), one pawn at a time in
//      pawn-list order over a fresh copy of the list per phase, with
//      Board::UpdateLeaders after each pawn.
//   3. Environment steps while the environment has more (Environment::apply).
//   4. Queued attacks: the first pawn in list order with a queued shot fires
//      it from its current tile (Engine's queued-effect path), until none is
//      left. Smoke, death, freezing and water cancel shots as frames run.
//   5. State 2: the victory check (the final turn ends the mission here),
//      the mission's NextTurn hooks, then the queued spawns one at a time:
//      a free tile gets the Vek, a blocked one takes 1 push-mode damage and
//      keeps its spawn for next turn; spawns on water or chasm are dropped.
//
// It stops before AI planning: the result is the board the player's turn was
// scored against ("this turn's result"). Mission per-frame hooks run at every
// simulated frame (Environment::update).
