// Content hashes of a Board for search (stage 9 transposition tables).
//
// A BoardHash is a 128-bit hash of every field of the board: tiles, the pawn
// list in board-list order with every pawn field, and the board's public
// state. Two boards with equal hashes behave the same for every rule in the
// engine (up to a 128-bit collision, ~2^-64 at 10^9 boards).
//
// One canonicalization makes boards that differ only in history hash equal:
// Pawn::arrival stamps are replaced by each pawn's rank among the pawns on
// its tile. The engine only ever compares stamps of pawns that share a tile,
// and a new stamp is always larger than every existing one, so the ranks are
// all that the stamps can decide. (Moving A then B or B then A gives the same
// board, but not the same stamps.)
