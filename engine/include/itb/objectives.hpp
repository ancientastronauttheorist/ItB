// Stage 8: mission objectives (score tier 3) and the position metric (tier 5).
//
// The game judges objectives in Lua (missions.lua Mission:GetBonusStatus,
// each mission's GetCompletedObjectives) at the end of the mission, plus a
// few native counters (Game:GetEventCount: EVENT_ENEMY_KILLED,
// EVENT_SPAWNBLOCKED, EVENT_ACID_DESTROYED, EVENT_MOUNTAIN_DESTROYED,
// EVENT_REPAIR_PICKUP). A turn is scored on one concrete outcome, from the
// board at the start of the player's turn to the board after the enemy
// phase, in two quantities:
//
//   ObjectivesFailed  stars lost for good during this turn. Stars are the
//                     game's own reward units: each objective's Objective(...,
//                     value) reputation, power or asset reward (a bonus
//                     objective is 1; "protect both tanks" is 2, 1 per tank).
//                     Latched failures count when they happen (a protected
//                     unit dies, an objective building is damaged, the kill
//                     limit is exceeded); objectives decided at mission end
//                     count on the turn the mission ends (phase->mission_ended).
//   ObjectiveProgress progress towards stars not yet earned, in kStar units
//                     per star (840 = lcm(1..8), so "1 of 5 kills" is exact):
//                     kills toward a kill target, blocked spawns, destroyed
//                     targets, launched rockets, thawed buildings, collected
//                     pods, ... It can be negative (fires put out, bots
//                     thawed).
//
// A pawn "dies" when it was alive at the start and is dead or gone at the end,
// except pawns that left without dying: a retreat (the minor flag set, HP 0,
// tile_rules retreat), a satellite rocket that launched (removed, not dead) and
// the Mission_Hacking bot replaced by its player-team copy.
//
// Each line says whether recorded data pins it down (`exact`); see the
// README's objective table.
