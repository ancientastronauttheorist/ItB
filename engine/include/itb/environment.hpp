// Stage 7: mission environments and mission combat hooks.
//
// In game a mission is a Lua object (GAME.Missions[k]) with a LiveEnvironment
// (Env_Airstrike, Env_Tides, ...). The enemy phase drives both through a few
// Lua calls: IsEnvironmentEffect / ApplyEnvironmentEffect (the environment
// steps), BaseUpdate (every frame: UpdateMission hooks such as the dam flood
// or the acid storm), NextTurn with the enemy team, and IsEndBlocked.
// `Environment` is that interface. The native implementations
// (make_native_environment) rebuild the mission's state from what the bridge
// recorded; a Lua-backed implementation that runs the real mission scripts can
// replace them behind the same interface once the bridge exports the mission
// instance (stage 7 spec section 4).
//
// Where the recorded data does not pin the behaviour down, an environment
// says so (PhaseEventType::EnvInexact / EnvUnsupported) or, for hidden random
// choices, asks the chance-node resolver (EnvHost::choose).
