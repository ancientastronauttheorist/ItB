# ITB engine

A clean-room C++ rules engine for Into the Breach, built to back a provably
optimal per-turn solver. The goal is "perfect turns": given the board a
player can see, find the best actions, simulating through the end of the
enemy phase. Ranking uses strict priority tiers: grid and buildings, then
mech survival, then objectives, then kills, then position.

The behavior comes from reading the game (the unstripped Linux build
21601364 in Ghidra, plus the shipped Lua). This directory contains only
original code and written rules. Game files, decompiler output and Ghidra
projects stay local and are never committed.

## Build and test

```bash
cmake -S engine -B engine/build -G Ninja
cmake --build engine/build
engine/build/itb_tests
```

Dependencies are fetched and pinned by hash: Lua 5.1.5 (the game's Lua
version), doctest and nlohmann/json.

Some tests run the game's own scripts. By default they look for the local
copy at `.local_decompile/builds/linux_21601364`; set `ITB_GAME_DIR` to use
another install, i.e. any directory that contains `scripts/scripts.lua`.
Without a game install, those tests warn and skip.

## Tools

```bash
engine/build/itb_inspect recordings/<run>/m07_turn_01_solve_input.json  # render a recorded board
engine/build/itb_inspect --pawns                                        # every pawn definition
engine/build/itb_inspect --scripts                                      # script load report
engine/build/itb_inspect --corpus recordings                            # load all recorded boards
engine/build/itb_inspect --weapons recordings                           # run weapon Lua on recorded boards
```

## How game data is loaded

`GameData::load` runs the game's scripts in Lua 5.1, in the same
`GetScripts()` order the game uses. It supplies:

- the constants and value classes the binary binds natively (`Point`,
  `SpaceDamage`, `SkillEffect`, the list types), with luabind's rules;
- inert stubs for the remaining native functions the scripts call while
  loading (UI classes only).

The stubs are discovered automatically and reported, and the load verifies
that no stub shadows a Lua definition. Pawn definitions are read with normal
Lua inheritance. That covers every `AddPawn` entry plus every global table
derived from `Pawn`: 232 definitions in build 21601364.

## Status

Done so far (build order from the decompile):

- **Stage 1: core state and data.**
   - `core.hpp`: constants and A1–H8 notation.
   - `board.hpp`: tiles, pawns, and the pawn-list order that `Board::AddPawn`
     produces.
   - `game_data.hpp`: all pawn definitions, read from the game's scripts.
   - `recording.hpp`: all 469 recorded boards load.
- **Stage 2: per-tile damage and status rules** (`tile_rules.hpp`).
   - The game's ordered `DamageSpace` steps in both modes (weapon and
     push/bump).
   - Pawn damage: shields, frozen, turn shield, armor and ACID.
   - Terrain, buildings and grid, cracks, items/mines.
   - Fire, smoke, acid and freeze interactions, terrain dangers, and a `settle`
     that applies the game's per-frame rules until the board stops changing.
   - Grid Defense resists are a chance node: the caller resolves each roll, and
     every roll is logged. Pushes, spawns and Lua scripts are recorded for the
     later stages.
- **Stage 5: movement** (`movement.hpp`).
   - Pathing profiles, move budget and pilot move skills.
   - The game's reachability search and its weighted A* walk path (float32,
     (f, x, y) tie-break).
   - Walks, leaps, charges, teleports and burrows. Callers settle the tile a
     move ends on (arrival hazards are stage 2 rules).
   - Every first move the old bot executed in a recording is reachable here:
     `itb_inspect --moves recordings`.

- **Stage 6: the Lua host** (`lua_host.hpp`).
   - Runs the game's own weapon scripts (`GetTargetArea`, `GetSkillEffect`,
     queued Vek attacks, two-click weapons) and death effects on an engine
     Board, as the accuracy reference for C++ ports.
   - Native bindings follow luabind's rules: exact-arity overloads, strict
     argument types, aliasing `SpaceDamage&` / field references, one shared
     instance metatable (so `tostring(p)` and pawn `==` raise, as in game).
   - `random_int`, `random_bool` and `math.random` share a glibc `rand()`
     clone. Live seeds are hidden, so seeded results (e.g. the Large Goo
     split) are one sample of a random outcome.
   - Board queries read the engine Board directly; mutating bindings are
     reported (`LuaWrite`), not applied.
   - All 559 weapon ids run on the test boards without Lua errors, and
     every mech weapon and queued Vek attack in the recordings runs cleanly:
     `itb_inspect --weapons recordings`.

Next up: stage 3 (push and death resolution) and stage 4 (the SkillEffect
executor).

Integration debts:

- Lua host and executor: `Skill::PrepareEffect` (empty `sAnimation` := the
  weapon's `Explosion`, owner team, projectile source) and
  `CheckAlterations` (Vek Hormones, Boost) run after Lua returns and belong
  to the executor. So does running each entry's `sScript` (`run_script`)
  and applying the `LuaWrite`s it reports. `to_engine` drops the fields the
  engine `SpaceDamage` lacks so far (animation and flags, sound, art).

- Injured's per-step HP loss in `set_space` is a plain decrement for now. It
  should go through `modify_health` once moves carry a `RulesContext`, so the
  turn shield and Retaliation apply.
- A tile's occupant order is approximated by board-list order.

### Open questions for live-game testing

- **Vek attack order.** The decompile says board-list order, which is
  insertion order within the player and non-player groups. Recordings made
  before 2026-06-23 only have a bot-computed uid order, and just 3 later
  boards carry the game's real order. Confirm against the live game,
  especially for re-added pawns.
- **Injured and walking.** AE Injured costs 1 HP per tile change. The code
  suggests every step of a walk counts (and undoing the move costs 1 more);
  check in game.
- **Point plus number.** What `Point + number` means natively. It's only
  seen in UI layout code so far.
