"""Play Into the Breach live with the C++ engine (engine/build/itb_live).

Nothing runs on import; every command checks the bridge first (fresh
heartbeat, a readable state, `bridge_ext_disabled` unset) and refuses to act
otherwise.

    python3 scripts/live_play.py status
    python3 scripts/live_play.py deploy [--tiles C5,D6,E5] [--dry-run]
    python3 scripts/live_play.py turn [--time 10] [--max-time 120] [--min-tiers 5] [--threads 8] [--dry-run]
    python3 scripts/live_play.py end-turn
    python3 scripts/live_play.py mission [--max-turns 8]

turn: solve the live board, then execute the plan one sub-action at a time
(MOVE_NATIVE; ATTACK / TWO_CLICK_ATTACK with the weapon's slot; REPAIR) and
after each one compare the live board with the engine's prediction (units by
uid: type, tile, HP, statuses; building HP; never the save-based grid_power,
which is stale mid-turn). A mismatch re-solves from the live board, with the
same budget. Does not end the turn. The solve budget is adaptive: --time is
the base, kept when the plan is proven optimal in its first --min-tiers score
tiers (5: grid, buildings, mechs lost, mech HP, objectives failed); otherwise
the search goes on, proving only those tiers, up to --max-time. Execution is
native only: the bridge is put in EXEC_MODE native (every action is the game's own Pawn:FireWeapon with the mech selected, no
emulated damage, moves or repairs) and a bridge without it is refused; an
action the game refuses, or one sent while the game is busy, is an error ack
and stops the turn (no fallback to SetSpace moves).

end-turn: predicts the enemy phase from the board as it is, sends the bridge
END_TURN (it deactivates every mech, so no "units can still act" dialog),
clicks End Turn only if the bridge cannot end the turn itself, checks the
phase really changed, waits for the next player turn and compares grid, HP,
statuses, survivors and mech tiles with the prediction (Vek tiles are not
compared: the Vek move while the AI plans). New units are reported as spawns.
The prediction starts from the engine's queued shots where the bridge's are
stale (the bridge reads them from the save, written at turn start, so a shot
the turn cleared or retargeted still shows): each step's predicted shots are
kept for the units the live board confirmed (the run's manifest carries them
from `turn` to `end-turn`), and re-solves use them too.
A Burrower hurt during the turn dives and leaves the board (the bridge then
omits it) until the AI's move brings it up: the engine's boards list it under
"underground", and the driver carries it (by uid, from the engine) into
re-solves and the end-of-turn prediction, so a resurfacing Burrower is
matched by uid, not reported as a spawn.
Notes, not differences: a Vek picking up an acid pool while the AI plans; a
Grid Defense resist the prediction (worst case: no resist) could not know; a
Soldier Psion / Psion Abomination emerging from a hidden spawn (+1 HP to
every Vek).

mission: turn + end-turn until the mission ends; stops at the first anomaly
(a step mismatch, a bridge error, an enemy-phase difference, a refused plan)
without ending the turn, so the board can be inspected.

deploy: places the mechs on the bridge's exported drop zone (tiles the deploy
UI refuses are not in it, and DEPLOY refuses them anyway) with a simple
heuristic, or on --tiles; verifies every mech's tile from the state. Confirm
the deployment in the game afterwards.

Every bridge state and engine prediction is archived under
recordings/live/<run>/ (git-ignored; force-add a run to keep it): the
turn-start board as m<MM>_turn_<TT>_solve_input.json, the executed plan as
m<MM>_turn_<TT>_solve.json (both in the old recordings' format, so
itb_inspect --corpus/--solve/--moves read them), every other state as
m<MM>_turn_<TT>_<label>_<NN>.json and each prediction beside it as
..._prediction.json. events.jsonl logs every command and ack.

Coordinates are the bridge's (x, y); the console prints A1-H8 as well.

    turn-start uids) are matched by uid; others by type/tile/HP (the engine
    numbers the units it creates itself). After the enemy phase only mech
    tiles are compared, and new units are notes (spawns), not differences.

    Expected differences after the enemy phase, reported as notes:
    - `acid_pools` are the pool tiles before the enemy phase: a Vek that moves
      onto one while planning next turn (the AI move the engine doesn't
      model) picks up ACID.
    - `mines_gone` are the mine tiles (Item_Mine) before the enemy phase that
      the game no longer has after it: a Vek that walks onto one while
      planning next turn dies there. A non-mech the engine has alive and the
      game has dead is a note while there are tripped mines to account for it.
    - `random_thaw` (the prediction thawed frozen enemies at random:
      Mission_Reactivation thaws 2 random frozen Vek each enemy turn, a chance
      node the prediction takes one outcome of): enemies whose frozen flag
      differs are a note when as many stayed frozen as the engine thawed
      (the game picked other ones).
    - `resist` (only when the prediction had chance nodes): {"before": the
      board before the enemy phase, "tiles": the Grid Defense roll tiles, or
      None if the prediction does not list them}. The engine predicts every
      roll as not resisted (the worst case); a building the prediction
      damaged that the game shows with more HP (at most its HP before), with
      the grid higher by exactly the HP the buildings kept, was resisted.
    - A Soldier Psion / Psion Abomination that emerged from a hidden spawn
      (new in the game, absent from the prediction) gives every Vek +1 HP on
      arrival: +1 HP on a known non-mech unit of the psion's team.
    - `xp_split`: the prediction split squad XP whose remainder (a random
      draw) could level a pilot up; it takes the fewest level-ups, so a mech
      with exactly 2 HP more (a Health / Skilled level-up) is a note.
    - A Burrower the engine has underground (want["underground"]; it dove
      after a hit) that the game shows again after the enemy phase came up in
      the AI's move (not modelled): matched by uid on type and HP, a note.
