# Whole-program native facts

This directory is the publication boundary for build-keyed whole-program
analysis of `Breach.exe`. Eligible artifacts contain normalized facts only:

- executable and content identity;
- function entry RVAs, body ranges, sizes, and SHA-256 values;
- Ghidra analysis names and their source classification;
- Ghidra-declared direct internal call edges; and
- explicit discovery/omission counts.

Do not commit game binaries, copied executable bytes, disassembly, Ghidra
projects, decompiler output, reconstructed proprietary source, or absolute
installation paths. Keep those under the ignored `.local_decompile/` workbench.

## Export

Import the exact inventoried `Breach.exe` into a local Ghidra project stored
outside Git. Run `scripts/ghidra/ExportItbProgramFacts.java` after auto-analysis
finishes. The script accepts one argument: the destination TSV path.

The raw TSV is local working material. Normalize and verify it against the
exact executable and installation inventory:

```powershell
python -X utf8 scripts/itb_program_facts.py build `
  --executable "B:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Into the Breach\Breach.exe" `
  --inventory data/observatory/inventories/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_post_spawn_coordinate_capsule_restore_20260829.json `
  --ghidra-facts .local_decompile/windows_build_13725832/program_facts.tsv `
  --output data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_program_facts.json
```

Repository output is restricted to a direct child of this directory and is
written atomically. Existing non-atlas artifacts are never replaced.

## Verify

```powershell
python -X utf8 scripts/itb_program_facts.py verify `
  --executable "B:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Into the Breach\Breach.exe" `
  --inventory data/observatory/inventories/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_post_spawn_coordinate_capsule_restore_20260829.json `
  --evidence data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_program_facts.json
```

A successful verification proves that every recorded body range and hash still
matches that executable. It does not prove Ghidra found every function, chose
every boundary correctly, or that every declared direct flow independently
decodes as a call instruction. It also does not resolve indirect calls or
recover semantics. Focused decoder-backed boundary artifacts remain the route
for promoting particular edges to independent instruction facts.

## Native function review accounting

The program-facts atlas is also the immutable denominator for a separate
one-to-one review ledger:

- `windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_native_function_review_registry.json`
  contains only explicit analyst claims and is pinned to the canonical atlas
  hash;
- `windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_native_function_accounting.json`
  contains exactly one derived record for every atlas function; and
- `scripts/itb_native_function_accounting.py` exact-verifies the executable,
  inventory, atlas, registry, repository evidence, and rebuilt ledger before
  accepting the result.

Build and verify the ledger with:

```powershell
python -X utf8 scripts/itb_native_function_accounting.py build `
  --executable "B:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Into the Breach\Breach.exe" `
  --inventory data/observatory/inventories/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_full_decompile_baseline_20260830.json `
  --program-facts data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_program_facts.json `
  --registry data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_native_function_review_registry.json `
  --output data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_native_function_accounting.json

python -X utf8 scripts/itb_native_function_accounting.py verify `
  --executable "B:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Into the Breach\Breach.exe" `
  --inventory data/observatory/inventories/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_full_decompile_baseline_20260830.json `
  --program-facts data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_program_facts.json `
  --registry data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_native_function_review_registry.json `
  --evidence data/observatory/programs/windows_build_13725832_31fe35265598_native_function_accounting.json
```

The initial registry deliberately has no claims. The resulting ledger accounts
for all 25,312 atlas functions at L0, with all 25,312 ownership and subsystem
values still `unknown`, zero L1/L2 promotions, and zero reviewed exclusions.
It separately exposes 685 Ghidra-thunk flags and 26 repeated-body groups
covering 64 functions as review candidates. Those candidates never change a
review field, level, ownership, or exclusion.

Every future registry claim must be in increasing RVA order and pin the
canonical hash of the complete atlas function record. Levels are derived
rather than trusted. L1 requires a reviewed exact boundary, resolved
ownership, reviewed immediate references, and fact/inference evidence; L2
also requires first-party subsystem, purpose, inputs/outputs, and native/Lua
boundary classifications. L0 records cannot publish resolved L1/L2 fields,
and L1 records cannot publish the L2-only fields, so hypothesis or partial
claims cannot silently alter the authoritative ownership/subsystem partitions.

Promotions use a fail-closed three-layer evidence contract:

1. A dedicated `pe_native_function_review_evidence` record must repeat every
   claimed dimension exactly, carry the complete type-strict atlas build
   identity, and cite every support class required by the derived level.
2. Each cited `pe_native_function_support_evidence` record must bind its class
   to the canonical hash of the exact structured assertion, carry evidence at
   least as strong as the claim, and contain nonempty sorted repository-local
   source references.
3. Every upstream source kind must have a registered kind-specific adapter.
   The adapter validates that artifact's native schema and derives the
   structured assertion; repeating an assertion hash in an unknown JSON kind
   is never accepted.

All paths, file hashes, JSON pointers, identities, and pointed records are
verified on every build. Windows drive-relative paths, NTFS alternate data
streams, reserved names, symlinks, junctions, and changed parent directories
fail closed. The production adapter allowlist is intentionally empty in this
initial L0 tranche, so no registry promotion is accepted yet. The next review
tranches must add narrow adapters for independently verified Observatory
artifact kinds before adding claims.

Only third-party and compiler-runtime exclusions have a generic v1 shape, and
they still require typed ownership plus exclusion support through an
allowlisted adapter. `unreachable`, `duplicate_thunk`, and `data_only` fail
closed until specialized proofs exist: complete roots/reachability for the
first, a retained canonical target plus proven transfer/equivalence for the
second, and an independently proven boundary misclassification for the third.

The ledger does not turn Ghidra names, namespaces, address neighborhoods,
sizes, thunk flags, repeated bodies, or call records into ownership or
semantics. Its 25,312-record denominator is still the Ghidra-discovered atlas,
whose bodies cover 92.99% of file-backed executable-section bytes. The
remaining 281,434 executable bytes, 18,477 computed or unmapped call targets,
indirect flow, focused regions that do not exactly match atlas bodies, and all
L3 behavior remain explicit future work.
